title: "Upload File"
openapi: post /uploadfile
---

This endpoint is used to directly upload local files to Carbon. The POST request should be a multipart form request. Note that the set_page_as_boundary query parameter is applicable only to PDFs for now. When this value is set, PDF chunks are at most one page long. Additional information can be retrieved for each chunk, however, namely the coordinates of the bounding box around the chunk (this can be used for things like text highlighting).
