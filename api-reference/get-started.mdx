## Base URL

The Carbon API is built on REST principles, enforcing HTTPS in every request to enhance data security, integrity, and privacy. Please note that the API does not support HTTP.

All requests should be directed to the following base URL:

```
https://api.carbon.ai
```

## Authentication 

<Note>Please schedule a [15-minute call](https://cal.com/carbon-ai/15min?date=2023-11-13&month=2023-11) to get your _*free*_ Carbon API key.</Note>

Our API supports two header-based authentication methods: 

### Carbon API Key and Customer ID
For API key-based authentication, you can pass in your API key and `customer-id`. The `customer-id` is a unique identifier that denotes an individual user in your system.

```
Content-Type: application/json
authorization: Bearer <API KEY>
customer-id: <customer-id>
```

### Access Token
You can generate an access token via the `/auth/v1/access_token` endpoint, and the access token can be used without needing to pass in a separate `customer-id` in the header.

Access tokens are valid for 10 hours, after which you need to generate a new token.

```
Content-Type: application/json
authorization: Token <TOKEN>
```

## Rate Limit

The maximum number of file upload requests that users can send is 20 requests per minute. 

After that, you’ll hit the rate limit and receive a 429 response error code.

To prevent this, we recommend reducing the rate at which you request the API. This can be done by introducing a queue mechanism or reducing the number of concurrent requests per second. If you have specific requirements, contact support to request a rate increase.

## Response Codes

Carbon uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.


| Status | Description                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| `200`    | Successful request.                           |
| `400`    | Check that the parameters were correct.       |
| `401`    | User doesn't have access to the resource.        |
| `403`    | User authorization issue.                 |
| `404`    | The resource was not found.                   |
| `429`    | The rate limit was exceeded.                  |
| `5xx`    | Indicates an error with Carbon servers.       |

  <Accordion title="How does pagination work with the API?">
    You can use `limit-offset` pagination to paginate data by limit and offset.

  <Accordion title="How do you handle API versioning?">
    Currently, there’s no versioning system in place. We plan to add versioning via calendar-based headers in the future.
