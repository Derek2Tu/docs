<Note>Please schedule a [15-minute call](https://cal.com/carbon-ai/15min?date=2023-11-13&month=2023-11) to get your _*free*_ Carbon API key.</Note>

Our API supports two header-based authentication methods: 

### Carbon API Key and Customer ID
For API key-based authentication, you can pass in your API key and `customer-id`. The `customer-id` is a unique identifier that denotes an individual user in your system.

```
Content-Type: application/json
authorization: Bearer <API KEY>
customer-id: <customer-id>
```

### Access Token
You can generate an access token via the `/auth/v1/access_token` endpoint, and the access token can be used without needing to pass in a separate `customer-id` in the header.

Access tokens are valid for 10 hours, after which you need to generate a new token.

```
Content-Type: application/json
authorization: Token <TOKEN>
```
