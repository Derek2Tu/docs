## Step 1: Generate OAuth URL

To initiate the integration process, follow these steps:

1. Visit the Carbon OAuth URL generation endpoint: `/oauth_url`
2. Generate an OAuth URL specifically for Confluence
3. Click on the generated URL to begin the authentication process with your user's Confluence account

## Step 2: Verify Account Connection

After successfully authenticating your Confluence account, verify the connection:

1. Navigate to the Carbon user data sources endpoint: `/user_data_sources`
2. Check if your user's Confluence account is listed, indicating a successful connection

## Step 3: Select Files to Sync

<Note>Specific connectors such as Google and Dropbox have their own file selectors, so this step is not required.</Note>

To sync specific files and folders from Confluence to Carbon, follow these steps:

1. Browse your Confluence file directory using the Carbon file listing endpoint: `/integrations/items/list`
2. Select the desired files and folders you want to sync to Carbon
3. Pass the selected items to the Carbon file sync endpoint: `/integrations/files/sync`
4. The sync process will begin, syncing the content of the selected files to Carbon

<Tip>Steps #1-3 above can be managed via our pre-built [Carbon Connect React component](/carbon-connect) as well.</Tip>

## Step 4: Access Synced Files

Once the sync process is complete, you can access the synced files in Carbon:

1. Visit the Carbon user files endpoint: `/user_files_v2`
    - By setting `include_raw_file` to `true`, you can retrieve a pre-signed URL for the uploaded file in its original format (e.g., PDF, DOCX, etc.). This allows you to access and download the file as it was initially uploaded by the user.
    - By setting `include_parsed_text_file` to `true`, you can retrieve a plain text version of the uploaded file. This can be useful when you need to process or analyze the content of the file without dealing with the original file format.
2. The synced files will maintain their original directory structure from Confluence

## Step 5: Retrieve Embeddings

Carbon provides powerful embedding capabilities for your synced files:

1. Retrieve embeddings and content using the Carbon embeddings endpoint: `/embeddings`
2. Alternatively, you can retrieve the embeddings and chunks and store it in your own vector database: `/text_chunks`

## Step 6: Resync Files (Optional)

If you make changes to files in Confluence after the initial sync, you can resync them to update the versions in Carbon:

1. Use the Carbon file resync endpoint: `/resync_file`
2. Specify the individual files you want to resync

## Step 7: Set Up Auto-Sync (Optional)

To keep your files automatically in sync between Confluence and Carbon, you can enable scheduled auto-sync:

1. Set up auto-sync at the organization level using the Carbon update organization endpoint: `/organization/update`
2. Alternatively, enable auto-sync for individual users using the Carbon update users endpoint: `/update_users`

By following these steps, you'll be able to seamlessly integrate your Confluence account with Carbon, sync your files, and leverage Carbon's advanced features to supercharge your development workflow. Happy building with Carbon!

## Step 8: Add Webhooks (Optional)
<Note>For testing, you can create a tunnel to your localhost server using a tool like ngrok. For example: https://5f9f-98-14-198-85.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook</Note>
1. Add a URL to which webhooks should be sent. This can be done using the `/add_webhook` endpoint.
2. The response from the `/add_webhook` endpoint includes a `signing_key`. Save this key securely as it is used to validate the authenticity of received webhooks and cannot be retrieved again.
3. You can create a tunnel to your localhost server using a tool like ngrok. For example: https://5f9f-98-14-198-85.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook
4. At this point, all events will be sent to the URL specified in Step 1. An event - sent via an HTTP POST request - contains two important elements: a `Carbon-Signature` header and a body with a single key-value pair. You can validate the authenticity and integrity of the webhook by calculating its signature.
5. To ensure that the webhooks are genuine and have not been tampered with, you should validate the incoming webhooks using the `signing_key` from Step 2.
6. Once you receive and handle the webhook, you should respond to the POST request with a `200` status - otherwise, the webhook will be retried (up to three times).
