When you do not pass `open` or `setOpen`, CC will manage the open state internally. If you pass `open` and `setOpen`, you will have to manage the open state yourself.

### Note about Google Drive

Our oAuth app is in approval phase. your users will see a warning message when they try to connect their Google account. Please ignore the warning and proceed to connect your account. We will update this section once our app is approved.

## Usage

---

This section demonstrates how to integrate the CarbonConnect component within a Next.js project.

### Client Side Configuration

1. Import necessary libraries and components:

```jsx
import { CarbonConnect } from 'carbon-connect';
import axios from 'axios';
```

2. Token Retrieval:
  The tokenFetcher function is set up to request access tokens from Carbon directly via your backend:

```js
const tokenFetcher = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('/api/auth/fetchCarbonTokens', {
    params: { customer_id: 'your_customer_id' },
  });
  return response.data; // Must return data containing access_token
};
```
  In the example above, tokenFetcher is a helper function that retrieves the necessary tokens for authentication. This function should be implemented in your client-side code and is designed to make a request to an API on your backend server. The API then requests tokens from the Carbon token creation endpoint. The Carbon token creation endpoint is a secure endpoint that requires a valid API key and customer ID. The customer ID is a unique identifier for your end-user, and you can pass any string as the customer ID. The API key is a secret key provided to you by Carbon. Please contact us to obtain your API key.

3. Implement CarbonConnect Component:
   Here's a concise usage example. Customize according to your requirements:

```jsx
<CarbonConnect
  orgName="Your Organization"
  brandIcon="path/to/your/brand/icon"
  tokenFetcher={tokenFetcher}
  tags={{
    tag1: 'tag1_value',
    tag2: 'tag2_value',
    tag3: 'tag3_value',
  }}
  maxFileSize={10000000}
  enabledIntegrations={[
    {
      id: 'LOCAL_FILES',
      chunkSize: 100,
      overlapSize: 10,
      maxFileSize: 20000000,
      allowMultipleFiles: true,
      maxFilesCount: 5,
      allowedFileTypes: [
        {
          extension: 'csv',
          chunkSize: 1200,
          overlapSize: 120,
        },
        {
          extension: 'txt',
          chunkSize: 1599,
          overlapSize: 210,
        },
        {
          extension: 'pdf',
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 'NOTION',
      chunkSize: 1500,
      overlapSize: 20,
    },
    {
      id: 'WEB_SCRAPER',
      chunkSize: 1500,
      overlapSize: 20,
    },
    {
      id: 'GOOGLE_DRIVE',
      chunkSize: 1000,
      overlapSize: 20,
    },
  ]}
  onSuccess={(data) => console.log('Data on Success: ', data)}
  onError={(error) => console.log('Data on Error: ', error)}
  primaryBackgroundColor="#F2F2F2"
  primaryTextColor="#555555"
  secondaryBackgroundColor="#f2f2f2"
  secondaryTextColor="#000000"
  allowMultipleFiles={true}
  open={true}
  chunkSize={1500}
  overlapSize={20}
  // entryPoint="LOCAL_FILES"
></CarbonConnect>
```

### Server Side Configuration

Your backend should handle token requests like this:

```js
const response = await axios.get('https://api.carbon.ai/auth/v1/access_token', {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'customer-id': '<YOUR_USER_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER>',
    authorization: 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>',
  },
});
if (response.status === 200 && response.data) {
  res.status(200).json(response.data);
}
```

### Return Value Expectation:

Ensure that your tokenFetcher returns an object structured as:

```js
{
  access_token: string;
}
```

## Enable Data Sources

---

Another important prop is `enabledIntegrations`. This prop lets you choose which integrations to show in the component. You can also pass additional configuration for each integration. We have provided an example in the above code snippet. Here is the list of all the integrations that you can enable:

1. `LOCAL_FILES`: This integration lets you upload files from your local machine. You can pass the following configuration for this integration:

   - `chunkSize`: This is the no.of tokens per chunk. Defaults to 1500.
   - `overlapSize`: This is the size of the overlap in tokens. Defaults to 20.
   - `maxFileSize`: This is the maximum file size in bytes that is allowed to be uploaded. Defaults to 10 MB.
   - `allowMultipleFiles`: Whether or not to allow multiple files to be uploaded at once. Defaults to `false`.
   - `maxFilesCount`: This is the maximum no.of files that can be uploaded at once. Defaults to 10.
   - `skipEmbeddingGeneration`: Whether or not to skip embeddings generation. Defaults to `false`.
   - `allowedFileTypes`: This is an array of objects. Each object represents a file type that is allowed to be uploaded. Each object can have the following properties:
     - `extension`: The file extension of the file type. This is a required property.

## Callback Function Props

---

1.  `onError`: CC will also call another call back method if there is an error while uploading file. This function will pass data in the following format:

```js
{
  status: 400,
  action: 'UPDATE',
  event: 'UPDATE',
  integration: `<INTEGRATION_NAME>`, // 'LOCAL_FILES' or 'WEB_SCRAPER',
  data: `<data_object>`, // This field will be present only if the error is related to a file or web scraper
}
```

2. `onSuccess`: You can let CC trigger a callback function upon successful file upload, 3rd party account connection and file selection, Webscraping request initiation.

  ### `onSuccess`` Event Types

  1. `INITIATE`: This event type is triggered when a user enters the integration flow (either for auth or file selection)
  2. `ADD`: This event type is triggered when a user authenticates an account under an integration.
  3. `UPDATE`: This event type is triggered when a user adds or removes files for an integration. We’ll list the files added or removed.
  4. `CANCEL`: This event type is triggered when when a user exits the integration flow without taking any action.


  ### Data passed to `onSuccess` callback

  The data passed to the onSuccess callback prop will be:

  1. For `LOCAL_FILES`: 

  ```js
  {
    status: 200,
    data: {
      "data_source_external_id": null, // This field is not applicable for local files
      "sync_status": null, // This is not applicable for local files
      "files": <Array of objects corresponding to the files uploaded>, (Refer to the file object format below)
    },
    action: 'UPDATE'
    event: 'UPDATE'
    integration: 'LOCAL_FILES',
  }
  ```

  2. For `WEB_SCRAPER`: An array containing only one object in the following format

  ```js
  {
    status: 200,
    data: {
      "data_source_external_id": null, // This field is not applicable for webscrapers
      "sync_status": null, // This is not applicable for webscrapers
      "files": <Array of objects corresponding to the parent URLs submitted>, (Refer to the file object format below)
    },
    action: 'UPDATE'
    event: 'UPDATE'
    integration: 'WEB_SCRAPER',
  }

  ```

  3. For third party integrations: An array of objects. Each object will be in the following format:

  ```js
  {
    status: 200,
    data: {
      "data_source_external_id": <Unique ID for the data source>,
      "sync_status": <SYNC_STATUS>,
      "files": <Array of objects corresponding to the files / pages selected>,
    } or null,
    action: <ACTION_TYPE>, // `ACTION_TYPE` can be one of the following: `INITIATE`, `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `CANCEL`
    event: <EVENT_TYPE>, // `EVENT_TYPE` can be one of the following: `INITIATE`, `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `CANCEL`
    integration: <INTEGRATION_NAME>, // `INTEGRATION_NAME` can be one of the following: `LOCAL_FILES`, `NOTION`, `WEB_SCRAPER`, `GOOGLE_DRIVE`, `INTERCOM`, `DROPBOX`, `ONEDRIVE`
