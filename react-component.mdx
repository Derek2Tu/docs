## Usage

---

This section demonstrates how to integrate the Carbon Connect component within a Next.js project.

### Client Side Configuration

#### 1. Import Libraries and Components:

```jsx
import { CarbonConnect } from 'carbon-connect';
import axios from 'axios';
```

#### 2. Token Retrieval:
  The tokenFetcher function is set up to request access tokens from Carbon directly via your backend:

```js
const tokenFetcher = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('/api/auth/fetchCarbonTokens', {
    params: { customer_id: 'your_customer_id' },
  });
  return response.data; // Must return data containing access_token
};
```
  In the example above, tokenFetcher is a helper function that retrieves the necessary tokens for authentication. This function should be implemented in your client-side code and is designed to make a request to an API on your backend server. The API then requests tokens from the Carbon token creation endpoint. The Carbon token creation endpoint is a secure endpoint that requires a valid API key and customer ID. The customer ID is a unique identifier for your end-user, and you can pass any string as the customer ID. The API key is a secret key provided to you by Carbon. Please contact us to obtain your API key.

#### 3. Implement Carbon Connect Component:

   Here's a concise usage example. Customize according to your requirements:

```jsx
<CarbonConnect
  orgName="Your Organization"
  brandIcon="path/to/your/brand/icon"
  embeddingModel: 'OPENAI',
  tokenFetcher={tokenFetcher}
  tags={{
    tag1: 'tag1_value',
    tag2: 'tag2_value',
    tag3: 'tag3_value',
  }}
  maxFileSize={10000000}
  enabledIntegrations={[
    {
      id: 'LOCAL_FILES',
      chunkSize: 100,
      overlapSize: 10,
      maxFileSize: 20000000,
      allowMultipleFiles: true,
      maxFilesCount: 5,
      allowedFileTypes: [
        {
          extension: 'csv',
          chunkSize: 1200,
          overlapSize: 120,
          embeddingModel: 'OPENAI',
        },
        {
          extension: 'txt',
          chunkSize: 1599,
          overlapSize: 210,
          embeddingModel: 'AZURE_OPENAI',
        },
        {
          extension: 'pdf',
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 'NOTION',
      chunkSize: 1500,
      overlapSize: 20,
      embeddingModel: 'OPENAI',
    },
    {
      id: 'WEB_SCRAPER',
      chunkSize: 1500,
      overlapSize: 20,
    },
    {
      id: 'GOOGLE_DRIVE',
      chunkSize: 1000,
      overlapSize: 20,
    },
  ]}
  onSuccess={(data) => console.log('Data on Success: ', data)}
  onError={(error) => console.log('Data on Error: ', error)}
  primaryBackgroundColor="#F2F2F2"
  primaryTextColor="#555555"
  secondaryBackgroundColor="#f2f2f2"
  secondaryTextColor="#000000"
  allowMultipleFiles={true}
  open={true}
  chunkSize={1500}
  overlapSize={20}
  // entryPoint="LOCAL_FILES"
></CarbonConnect>
```

#### 4. Specify an Embedding Model (Optional)

If you are using Carbon to generate embeddings, in the Carbon Connect component, the specification of an embedding model [(view available models)](learn/models/models) can be set at different levels:

_*Global Level*_: Here, the Embedding Model (embeddingModel) prop applies universally across the entire system or application. It serves as the default unless overridden at other levels.

_*Per Connector Level*_: This setting applies to a specific connector (ie: Google Drive), allowing customization for a particular connector's behavior, which takes precedence over the global setting for that connector.

_*Per File Type Level*_: The most specific setting, it applies at the individual file level, allowing granular control over embedding models for particular file types. This setting supersedes both connector and global settings, providing the highest priority. This is applicable for local file uploads only.

The order of precedence is: File Level > Connector Level > Global Level. Meaning, if a specific embedding model is defined at the file level, it takes priority over the connector-level setting, and the connector-level setting takes priority over the global setting. We default to `OPENAI` if no value is provided.

### Server Side Configuration

Your backend should handle token requests like this:

```js
const response = await axios.get('https://api.carbon.ai/auth/v1/access_token', {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'customer-id': '<YOUR_USER_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER>',
    authorization: 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>',
  },
});
if (response.status === 200 && response.data) {
  res.status(200).json(response.data);
}
```

### Return Value

Ensure that your tokenFetcher returns an object structured as:

```js
{
  access_token: string;
}
```

# Callback Function Props

---

## onSuccess 

Responds to successful events: file upload, 3rd party account connection, file selection, and web scraping initiation.

### Event Types

  1. `INITIATE`: This event type is triggered when a user enters the integration flow (either for auth or file selection)
  2. `ADD`: This event type is triggered when a user authenticates an account under an integration.
  3. `UPDATE`: This event type is triggered when a user adds or removes files for an integration. We’ll list the files added or removed.
  4. `CANCEL`: This event type is triggered when when a user exits the integration flow without taking any action.


### Callback Response
  The data passed to the onSuccess callback prop will be:

 `LOCAL_FILES`: 

  ```js
  {
    status: 200,
    data: {
      "data_source_external_id": null, // This field is not applicable for local files
      "sync_status": null, // This is not applicable for local files
      "files": <Array of objects corresponding to the files uploaded>, (Refer to the file object format below)
    },
    action: 'UPDATE'
    event: 'UPDATE'
    integration: 'LOCAL_FILES',
  }
  ```

`WEB_SCRAPER`:

  ```js
  {
    status: 200,
    data: {
      "data_source_external_id": null, // This field is not applicable for webscrapers
      "sync_status": null, // This is not applicable for webscrapers
      "files": <Array of objects corresponding to the parent URLs submitted>, (Refer to the file object format below)
    },
    action: 'UPDATE'
    event: 'UPDATE'
    integration: 'WEB_SCRAPER',
  }

  ```

_*3rd Party Connectors*_

  ```js
  {
    status: 200,
    data: {
      "data_source_external_id": <Unique ID for the data source>,
      "sync_status": <SYNC_STATUS>,
      "files": <Array of objects corresponding to the files / pages selected>,
    } or null,
    action: <ACTION_TYPE>, // `ACTION_TYPE` can be one of the following: `INITIATE`, `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `CANCEL`
    event: <EVENT_TYPE>, // `EVENT_TYPE` can be one of the following: `INITIATE`, `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `CANCEL`
    integration: <INTEGRATION_NAME>, // `INTEGRATION_NAME` can be one of the following: `LOCAL_FILES`, `NOTION`, `WEB_SCRAPER`, `GOOGLE_DRIVE`, `INTERCOM`, `DROPBOX`, `ONEDRIVE`
  }
  ```

  Each `files` object follows this format:

  ```js
  {
      "id": `Unique ID for the file, can be used for resyncing, deleting, updating tags etc.`,
