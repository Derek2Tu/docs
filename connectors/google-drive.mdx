Google Slides, Google Docs and Google Sheets are supported with our Google Drive integration, along with regular text, audio and image files.

## Authorization Type

Carbon uses **[OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)** to connect to Google workspace.

## Authorization Flow

**Carbon's Google Drive integration is still pending approval from Google. In the meantime, end users are required to take a couple additional steps to connect their accounts (see gif below).**

Log into your Google Drive account.

## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials

1. Go to `APIs and Services` > `Enabled APIs and Services` in your Google Cloud console, then click on the button titled `ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES` and enable `Google Drive API` and `Google Picker API`.
2. Then create an `OAuth Client ID` in the `Credentials section` under `Google Drive API`. Select `Web Application` as the Application type and give it an identifiable name for your reference.

3. Add [https://api.carbon.ai](https://api.carbon.ai) as the `Authorized JS origin` and [https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/google](https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/google) as an `Authorized redirect URI`. 
You can also opt to use a custom CNAME record pointing to https://api.carbon.ai for the `Authorized JS Origin` and `Authorized redirect URI`. However, for the `Authorized redirect URI` the domain paths must still be `/integrations/google`.

4. Save the credentials. Download the credentials.json file once you save the OAuth Client ID data and share the file with Carbon.

5. Then create an `API key` in the `Credentials section` under `Google Picker API`. Restrict the application to websites and then add [https://api.carbon.ai](https://api.carbon.ai/) (or your custom CNAME) to the list under website restrictions. For `API Restrictions`, pick `Restrict key` and select `Google Picker API` from the list.

6. Save the API key. Copy the API key and share it with Carbon.

7. Configure your consent screen in the OAuth Consent Screen. Provide your **App name**, **support email address**, and **brand logo**. Add [carbon.ai](http://carbon.ai/) (or your custom CNAME) to `Authorized domain`.

9. If you wish to add test users, you can do so. These users will not see the "App is unverified" notification. Other users will see this alert.
10. Click `Publish App` to make this app available to your end-users.

## Synchronization

Syncs are triggered when end-users add or remove Google Drive files and folders via the Google Drive picker. When a user selects a folder to be synced, we auto-sync all files added to the folder as well.

You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Google Drive files.

In addition, we have a 24-hour batch sync running in the background. You can request us via Slack to run more frequent batch syncs.
