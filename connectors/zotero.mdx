## Functionality

Carbon allows users to upload `pdf`, `docx`, `pptx`,`txt`,`csv`, `png`, `rtf`, `tsv`, `xlsx`, `jpeg` and `md` files directly from Zotero.

## Synchronization

By default, Carbon syncs all attachments from your Zotero library along with the accompanying info as metadata.

You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Zotero files. To delete Zotero files from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

To sync Zotero files on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the `/update_users` endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated Zotero content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["ZOTERO"]
}
