## Authorization Type

Carbon uses **[OAuth 2.0](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/confluence-oauth2-provider-api/)** to connect to Confluence.

## Functionality

Carbon has the ability to synchronize Confluence pages and retrieve the contents of each page as HTML or plain text.

## Authorization Flow

Enter the `subdomain` of your Confluence workspace. For example, if the Confluence workspace URL is `https://carbon-ai.confluence.com`, `carbon-ai` is the subdomain.

Login to authenticate your Confluence account.

## Configuration

### Syncing Confluence Pages

<Note>We offer a pre-built File Picker UI for Confluence through Carbon Connect, since Confluence does not provider their own File Picker UI.</Note>

You can synchronize Confluence pages using the following steps:

_*Sync a User's Confluence Account*_
- Use the `/integrations/items/sync` endpoint to synchronize a user's Confluence account.

_*List All Items from a User's Confluence Account*_
- Retrieve a list of all items from a user's Confluence account by utilizing the `/integrations/items/list` endpoint.

_*Specify Specific Pages to Sync*_
- Employ the `/integrations/files/sync` endpoint to specify and synchronize specific pages.

If you are utilizing our Carbon Connect component, be aware that all pages are automatically synchronized by default.

### Custom OAuth Credentials

<Warning>Custom OAuth credentials is only required for customers who enable [white labeling](/learn/customize/whitelabel).</Warning>

## Synchronization

You can also use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Confluence pages. To delete Confluence pages from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

To sync Confluence files on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the /update_users endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated Confluence content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["CONFLUENCE"]
} 
```
