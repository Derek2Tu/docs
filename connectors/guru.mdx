## Authorization Type

Carbon uses **[Access Tokens](https://help.getguru.com/docs/gurus-api#obtaining-a-user-token)** to connect to Guru.

## Functionality

The Guru connector allows users to synchronize collections, folders, and cards from their Guru account. Users have the option to disable automatic synchronization and can manually sync using global endpoints.

## Authorization Flow

1. Log into your Guru account.

2. Obtain an access token by following the instructions here: https://help.getguru.com/docs/gurus-api#obtaining-a-user-token

3. Provide your Guru username and access token to Carbon via the `/integrations/guru` or `/integrations/connect` endpoint to grant Carbon access to your Guru data.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required beyond providing your Guru username and access token.

## Synchronization

By default, Carbon automatically synchronizes your Guru collections, folders, and cards. This includes text, images, and file attachments within the cards.

You can turn off automatic synchronization if desired. In this case, you can use the global endpoints to manually trigger synchronization of the same data.

To sync Guru data on a 24-hour schedule (*more frequent schedules available upon request*), you can use the `/update_users` endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated Guru content for specified users:

```json
{
  "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
  "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["GURU"]
}
```
