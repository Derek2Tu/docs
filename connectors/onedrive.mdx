## Functionality

Carbon allows users to upload `pdf`, `docx`, `pptx`,`txt`,`csv`, `png`, `rtf`, `tsv`, `xlsx`, `jpeg` and `md` files directly from OneDrive.

## Synchronization

Syncs are triggered when end-users select files to upload via the OneDrive file selector UI. You can also use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific OneDrive files. To delete OneDrive files from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

We do not run our 24-hour batch sync for OneDrive by default. If you'd like us to enable batch syncs to run in the background, you can request this via Slack.
