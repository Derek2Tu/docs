## Functionality

Carbon allows users to upload `pdf`, `docx`, `pptx`,`txt`,`csv`, `png`, `rtf`, `tsv`, `xlsx`, `jpeg` and `md` files directly from OneDrive.

## Synchronization

Syncs are triggered when end-users select files to upload via the OneDrive file selector UI. When a user selects a folder to be synced, we auto-sync all files added to the folder as well. 

You can also use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific OneDrive files. To delete OneDrive files from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

To sync OneDrive files on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the `/update_users` endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated OneDrive content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["ONEDRIVE"]
} 
```

## Microsoft Admin Approval

To allow Carbon to access your Microsoft applications (OneDrive and SharePoints), users might need to request admin consent approval. 

Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Gone through Carbon's managed OAuth flow and submitted the admin consent request (see screenshot below):
![](https://imagedelivery.net/_sHUUMiZokZ59YDFOZEZTw/e93b438c-a787-4d28-b3e6-4c36f613e600/public)
- An administrator role or designated reviewer role to review admin consent requests

### Approve the Request

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a Cloud Application Administrator who is a designated reviewer.

2. Navigate to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**.

3. Under **Activity**, select **Admin consent requests**.

4. Select the **My Pending** tab to view and act on the pending requests.

5. From the list, select the Carbon application that is being requested.

6. Review the request details:
   - Select **Review permissions and consent** to see what permissions are being requested by Carbon.
   - Select the **App details** tab to view the application details.
   - Select the **Requested by** tab to see who is requesting access and why.

7. **Approve the request** to grant admin consent to allow Carbon to access your Microsoft application. All requestors will be notified that their request for access is granted. This allows all users in your tenant to access Carbon unless otherwise restricted with user assignment.
