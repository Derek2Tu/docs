## Authorization Type

Carbon uses **[OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)** to connect to Gmail.

## Authorization Flow

After the user logs into their Gmail account, Carbon auto-syncs all emails based on the filters set via our API.

## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials

1. Go to `APIs and Services` > `Enabled APIs and Services` in your Google Cloud console, then click on the button titled `ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES` and enable `Gmail API`.
2. Then create an `OAuth Client ID` in the `Credentials section` under `Gmail API`. Select `Web Application` as the Application type and give it an identifiable name for your reference.

3. Add [https://api.carbon.ai](https://api.carbon.ai) as the `Authorized JS origin` and [https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/gmail](https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/gmail) as an `Authorized redirect URI`. 
You can also opt to use a custom CNAME record pointing to https://api.carbon.ai for the `Authorized JS Origin` and `Authorized redirect URI`. However, for the `Authorized redirect URI` the domain paths must still be `/integrations/gmail`.

4. Save the credentials. Download the credentials.json file once you save the OAuth Client ID data and share the file with Carbon.

5. Configure your consent screen in the OAuth Consent Screen. Provide your **App name**, **support email address**, and **brand logo**. Add [carbon.ai](http://carbon.ai/) (or your custom CNAME) to `Authorized domain`.

9. If you wish to add test users, you can do so. These users will not see the "App is unverified" notification. Other users will see this alert.
10. Click `Publish App` to make this app available to your end-users.

## Synchronization

After successfully connecting your Gmail account, you gain the ability to selectively sync emails by utilizing the `filters` parameter via the `/integrations/gmail/sync` endpoint. This parameter operates as a JSON object comprising key-value pairs, supporting both AND and OR operations. Presently, our system accommodates a specific set of keys as detailed below:

#### `label`
Represents predefined Gmail labels such as "Important" or custom labels created by the user.

#### `after`
Accepts a date in the format YYYY/mm/dd (e.g., 2023/12/31), enabling the retrieval of emails after a specified date.

#### `before`
Accepts a date in the format YYYY/mm/dd (e.g., 2023/12/31), enabling the retrieval of emails before a specified date.

#### `is` 
Supports values like `starred`, `important`, `snoozed`, and `unread` to filter emails based on these attributes.

It's crucial to adhere to the specified keys and values within the JSON object. Usage of keys or values outside this defined scope might result in unexpected behavior.

An example of a basic query with filters, which lists all emails that have the label `Test`:

```
{
    "filters": {
            "key": "label",
            "value": "Test"
        }
}
```

You can use AND and OR operation as follows. 

This setup ensures the retrieval of emails dated after January 7th that satisfy either of the two conditions: having the label "Personal" or being marked as 'starred'. The structure allows for the effective use of AND and OR operations to filter emails based on the defined criteria.

<Note>This example demonstrates the highest level of nesting we support. You can't add more AND/OR filters within the OR filter in the example below.</Note>

```
{
    "filters": {
        "AND": [
            {
                "key": "after",
                "value": "2024/01/07"
            },
            {
                "OR": [
                    {
                        "key": "label",
                        "value": "Personal"
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "is",
                        "value": "starred"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Gmail emails. To delete specific emails from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

We do not run our 24-hour batch sync for Gmail by default. If youâ€™d like us to enable batch syncs to run in the background, you can request this via Slack.
