## Authorization Type

Carbon uses **[OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)** to connect to Gmail.

## Authorization Flow

After the user logs into their Gmail account, Carbon then auto-sync all emails based on the filters set via our API.

## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials

1. Go to `APIs and Services` > `Enabled APIs and Services` in your Google Cloud console, then click on the button titled `ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES` and enable `Gmail API`.
2. Then create an `OAuth Client ID` in the `Credentials section` under `Gmail API`. Select `Web Application` as the Application type and give it an identifiable name for your reference.

3. Add [https://api.carbon.ai](https://api.carbon.ai) as the `Authorized JS origin` and [https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/gmail](https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/gmail) as an `Authorized redirect URI`. 
You can also opt to use a custom CNAME record pointing to https://api.carbon.ai for the `Authorized JS Origin` and `Authorized redirect URI`. However, for the `Authorized redirect URI` the domain paths must still be `/integrations/gmail`.

4. Save the credentials. Download the credentials.json file once you save the OAuth Client ID data and share the file with Carbon.

5. Configure your consent screen in the OAuth Consent Screen. Provide your **App name**, **support email address**, and **brand logo**. Add [carbon.ai](http://carbon.ai/) (or your custom CNAME) to `Authorized domain`.

9. If you wish to add test users, you can do so. These users will not see the "App is unverified" notification. Other users will see this alert.
10. Click `Publish App` to make this app available to your end-users.

## Synchronization

When a user connects their Gmail account, we auto-sync all emails based on the applied filters. 

Current filters supported are:
- Before Date (ie: Emails before Jan 23, 2023)
- After Date (ie: Emails after May 18, 2018)
- Specific Labels
- Starred Emails

The [advanced filtering logic](/learn/filters/filtering) Carbon supports for tags extends to filtering emails from Gmail too.

You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Gmail emails. To delete specific emails from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

We do not run our 24-hour batch sync for Gmail by default. If youâ€™d like us to enable batch syncs to run in the background, you can request this via Slack.
