### Overview

Our platform now offers a new category of endpoints that provide unified data directly from third-party sources, starting with CRM systems and specifically Salesforce. This integration allows you to access Accounts, Contacts, Leads, and Opportunities data from Salesforce using a set of dedicated endpoints.

### Endpoints

#### List Endpoints (POST)

The following endpoints are used to retrieve lists of data from Salesforce. These endpoints require a `data_source_id` and support various query parameters to customize the response.

- **Accounts**: `/integrations/data/crm/accounts`
- **Leads**: `/integrations/data/crm/leads`
- **Contacts**: `/integrations/data/crm/contacts`
- **Opportunities**: `/integrations/data/crm/opportunities`

#### Get Endpoints

These endpoints are used to retrieve specific data by ID from Salesforce. These endpoints also require a `data_source_id`.

- **Account by ID**: `/integrations/data/crm/accounts/{id}`
- **Lead by ID**: `/integrations/data/crm/leads/{id}`
- **Contact by ID**: `/integrations/data/crm/contacts/{id}`
- **Opportunity by ID**: `/integrations/data/crm/opportunities/{id}`

### Authentication

To access these endpoints, you must first connect your Salesforce account through our OAuth URL. No additional steps are required after authentication.

### Query Parameters

#### Common Parameters

- **`data_source_id`**: Required for all endpoints.
- **`page_size`**: Integer value specifying the number of records to return per page. Minimum is 200, and maximum is 2000. Applicable on list endpoints.
- **`next_cursor`**: String value used to retrieve the next set of results. Applicable on list endpoints.
- **`includes`**: List of additional data to include in the response. Currently supports `Tasks` and `Attachments`.
- **`include_remote_data`**: Boolean flag to include the raw data received from Salesforce in addition to our unified data.

#### Filter and Ordering Parameters

- **`filters`**: Object containing filter criteria. The structure and available filters vary by object type. Applicable on list endpoints.
- **`order_by`**: Field to order the results by. Available fields vary by object type. Applicable on list endpoints.
- **`order_dir`**: Direction of ordering, either `asc` or `desc`. Applicable on list endpoints.

### Example Usage

#### Retrieving a List of Accounts

```json
POST /integrations/data/crm/accounts HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data_source_id": "your_data_source_id",
  "page_size": 500,
  "includes": ["Tasks", "Attachments"],
  "filters": {
    "Name": {
      "operator": "contains",
      "value": "Example"
    }
  },
  "order_by": "Name",
  "order_dir": "asc",
  "include_remote_data": true
}
```

#### Retrieving a Specific Contact

```json
GET /integrations/data/crm/contacts/{id} HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data_source_id": "your_data_source_id",
  "include_remote_data": true
}
```

### Notes

- Ensure you replace `your_data_source_id` with your actual data source ID.
- The `filters`, `order_by`, and `order_dir` parameters must be used according to the object type you are querying. Refer to Salesforce documentation for valid fields and filter structures.
- The `include_remote_data` parameter can significantly increase the response size. Use it judiciously based on your requirements.
