## Authorization Type

Carbon uses **[OAuth 2.0](https://developers.intercom.com/building-apps/docs/setting-up-oauth)** to connect to Intercom workspaces.

## Authorization Flow

## Functionality

Carbon syncs all `Published` articles under a single Intercom workspace. Any `Draft` article won't be synced. We currently support only having a single Intercom workspace connected per `customer_id`.

## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials

1. After you create or log into your [Intercom Developer](https://developers.intercom.com/) account, click `New App` to create your own app.

2. Under the `Authentication` tab, click `Edit` -> `Use OAuth` -> `Add redirect URL` and then enter https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/intercom. You can also use a custom CNAME record pointing to https://api.carbon.ai but the domain path must still be `/integrations/intercom`.

3. Under the `Authentication` tab, click `Edit` and then add permissions for `Read one admin`, `Read and List Articles`, and `Read and Write Articles`. You can remove access to the other permissions.

## Synchronization

Syncs are triggered when end-users add or remove pages via the Intercom OAuth flow. You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Intercom files.

In addition, we have a 24-hour batch sync running in the background. You can request us via Slack to run more frequent batch syncs.
