## Authorization Flow

## Functionality
The `integrations/oauth_url` and `integrations/connect` endpoints sync articles by default, but tickets and conversations can also be optionally synced.

To customize the sync behavior, use the `file_sync_config` parameter:

```
"file_sync_config": {
  "auto_synced_source_types": ["TICKET"],
  "sync_attachments": true
}
```

- `auto_synced_source_types`: An array specifying the types of items to sync. Valid values are "ARTICLE" (default), "TICKET", and "CONVERSATION". To sync articles, conversations, and tickets, include all values in the array.
- `sync_attachments`: A boolean indicating whether to sync attachments from ticket comments. Set to true to enable attachment syncing.

#### Additional Endpoints
The following endpoints can be used with Intercom to list and sync items:
- `integrations/items/sync`: Sync items from Intercom
- `integrations/items/list`: List items from Intercom
- `integrations/files/sync`: Sync files from Intercom

#### Articles
Carbon can sync `Published` articles from multiple Intercom workspaces. Note that `Draft` articles will not be synced.

#### Tickets
Carbon can sync tickets and their associated file attachments. The following ticket information is available as tags for filtering:

```
{
  "ticket_type": "Support Request",
  "ticket_status": "resolved",
  "ticket_category": "Customer",
  "ticket_submitter": "example.user@projectmap.com",
  "ticket_assigned_team": "Technical",
  "ticket_assigned_admin": "swapnil@carbon.ai"
}
````

Use these tags to filter and organize synced tickets based on their properties.

#### Conversations
Carbon can sync conversations and their associated file attachments. The following conversation information is available as tags for filtering:

```
{
  "conversation_status": "open",
  "conversation_priority": "not_priority",
  "conversation_submitter": "example.user@projectmap.com",
  "conversation_assigned_team": "Support",
  "conversation_assigned_admin": "swapnil+int2@carbon.ai"
}
````

Use these tags to filter and organize synced tickets based on their properties.

3. Under the `Authentication` tab, click `Edit` to add permissions:

   - To sync user articles only, add these scopes: 
     - `Read one admin`
     - `Read and List Articles`

   - To sync tickets, add these scopes:

## Synchronization

Syncs for articles are triggered when end-users add or remove pages via the Intercom OAuth flow. You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Intercom files.

To sync Intercom articles or tickets on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the `/update_users` endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated Intercom content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["INTERCOM"]
}
