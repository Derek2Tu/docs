Any customer with a Pinecone account can bring their vector database to use with Carbon. Carbon automatically synchronizes content from user data sources (Google Drive, Notion, etc) and the embeddings in your Pinecone index.

## Instructions
Contact the Carbon team via email (team@carbon.ai) or Slack to share your Pinecone credentials with us securely.

Please provide a distinct host URL for each intended embedding model (ie: one for Cohere Embed v3 Multilingual, one for OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, and one for BM25 sparse vectors).
