## Synchronization
There is no automatic or global file sync functionality. Instead, users can rely on the `/integrations/slack/conversations` and `/integrations/slack/sync` endpoints to list and sync Slack conversations. 

### Conversation Listing
- Users can list their Slack conversations using the `/integrations/slack/conversations` endpoint
- The endpoint supports filtering conversations by type:
  - Public channels
  - Private channels
  - Private messages
  - Group conversations

### Conversation Syncing
- A dedicated sync endpoint `/integrations/slack/sync` is available which requires the following parameters:
  - `conversation_id` (required): The ID of the Slack conversation to sync
  - `after` (optional): A date filter to sync messages after a specific date

### Conversation Format
Messages are synced in 15-minute blocks. 

For example, all messages between 2:15 PM and 2:30 PM will be synced together. If there are replies to messages outside the 15-minute block, they will still be included in the same sync block.

Currently, only message content is synced. Attachments and reactions are not yet supported.
