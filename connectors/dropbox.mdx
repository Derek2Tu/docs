## Authorization Type

Carbon uses **[OAuth 2.0](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide)** to connect to Dropbox.

## Functionality

All text, audio, video, and image files are supported file formats via Dropbox, for both Personal and Business accounts. Dropbox has a limit of 50 MB per file, so a single uploaded file cannot exceed 50 MB.


## Authorization Flow

Log into your Dropbox account.

Once you've successfully authenticated your account, you can select files directly.

3. Add [https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/dropbox]() as a `Redirect URIs` and [carbon.ai](carbon.ai) as the `Chooser / Saver / Embedder domains`.  You can also use a custom CNAME record pointing to https://api.carbon.ai for both but the domain path must still be `/integrations/dropbox` for the `Redirect URIs`.

6. Click `Apply for Production` under the `Settings` tab to make this app available to your end-users.

## Functionality

Carbon allows users to upload `pdf`, `docx`, `pptx`,`txt`,`csv`, `png`, `rtf`, `tsv`, `xlsx`, `jpeg` and `md` files directly from Dropbox.

## Synchronization

Syncs are triggered when end-users select files to upload via the Dropbox file selector UI. When a user selects a folder to be synced, we auto-sync all files added to the folder as well.

You can also use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Dropbox files. To delete Dropbox files from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

To sync Dropbox files on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the `/update_users` endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated Dropbox content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["DROPBOX"]
} 
```
