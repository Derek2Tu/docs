## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials

3. Add [https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/dropbox]() as a `Redirect URIs` and [carbon.ai](carbon.ai) as the `Chooser / Saver / Embedder domains`.  You can also use a custom CNAME record pointing to https://api.carbon.ai for both but the domain path must still be `/integrations/dropbox` for the `Redirect URIs`.

4. Configure your app details under the `Branding` tab. These details will appear on the OAuth Consent Screen as well. Provide your **App name**, **Publisher**, and **App icons**.

## Functionality

Carbon allows users to upload `pdf`, `docx`, `pptx`,`txt`,`csv`, `png`, `rtf`, `tsv`, `xlsx`, `jpeg` and `md` files directly from Dropbox.

## Synchronization

Syncs are triggered when end-users select files to upload via the Dropbox file selector UI. You can also use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Dropbox files. To delete Dropbox files from Carbon, you can use the `deletefile` endpoint directly.

We do not run our 24-hour batch sync for Dropbox by default. If you'd like us to enable batch syncs to run in the background, you can request this via Slack.
