## Authorization Type

Carbon utilizes [Access Key-based authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) for connecting to GitHub repositories.

## Authorization Flow 
## Configuration

#### Step 1: Generate an Access Token

To enable synchronization of repositories with our system, users need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions. Follow the steps outlined in the GitHub documentation on [Managing Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

#### Step: 2 Post Credentials to Carbon

Once the access token is generated, users should submit their GitHub username and access token to our integration endpoint at `/integrations/github` or via our Carbon Connect UI. This action initiates the synchronization process by listing their repositories and their respective content within our system.

<Note>Users have the flexibility to set an expiry for their access tokens. If a token expires, they can simply generate a new one with the necessary permissions and post it to the same endpoint (`/integrations/github`). Our system automatically updates the data source with the new token, ensuring uninterrupted synchronization.</Note>

#### Step 3: Sync Github Files

After successfully connecting their GitHub account, users can leverage our API endpoints (`/integrations/items/list` and `/integrations/files/sync`) or the pre-built Carbon Connect file picker to effortlessly browse and sync files from their repositories. This streamlined process simplifies content management and ensures seamless collaboration within our platform.

## Functionality 

Carbon syncs Github files from all private and public repositories.

## Synchronization

You can also use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Github files. To delete Github files from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

We do not run our 24-hour batch sync for Confluence by default. If youâ€™d like us to enable batch syncs to run in the background, you can request this via Slack.
