title: 'S3'
description: 'The Carbon Connect `enabledIntegrations` value for AWS S3 is `S3`.'
---

All text, audio and image files are supported file formats via S3.

## Authorization Type

Carbon uses [Access Key based](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html) authentication to connect to S3.

## Functionality

Carbon allows users to upload [text](https://docs.carbon.ai/learn/files/text) and [audio](https://docs.carbon.ai/learn/files/audio) file formats directly from S3.


## Synchronization

#### Step 1: Generate IAM User and Access Key

Create an IAM user in AWS with the following permissions:

- **List all buckets:** Grant permissions to list all S3 buckets.
- **Read access to specific buckets and objects:** Allow read access to the buckets and objects intended for synchronization in Carbon. Ensure that new buckets added in the future grant access to this IAM user for object retrieval.

#### Step 2: Provide Credentials to Carbon

`POST` the generated credentials to the `/integrations/s3` endpoint in this format:

```json
{
    "access_key": "<<your-access-key>>",
    "access_key_secret": "<<access-key-secret>>"
}
```

#### Step 3: List Files and Buckets
Optionally load all available S3 buckets and objects by using _*POST*_ `/integrations/items/sync` and list them via _*POST*_ `/integrations/items/list`.

#### Step 4: Sync Files or Buckets
Use the `/integrations/s3/files` endpoint to sync specific file objects or buckets.

For syncing specific files (multiple files allowed):
```json
{
    "ids": [{"bucket": "bucket-name", "id": "object-key"}],
    "tags": "...",
    "chunk_size": "...",
    "chunk_overlap": "...",
    "skip_embedding_generation": "..."
}
```

For syncing all files from buckets (multiple buckets allowed):
```json
{
    "ids": [{"bucket": "bucket-name"}],
    "tags": "...",
    "chunk_size": "...",
    "chunk_overlap": "...",
    "skip_embedding_generation": "..."
}
```

You can also use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific S3 files. To delete S3 files from Carbon, you can use the `delete_file` endpoint directly.

We do not run our 24-hour batch sync for S3 by default. If you'd like us to enable batch syncs to run in the background, you can request this via Slack.
