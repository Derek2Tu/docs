## Authorization Type

Carbon uses [Access Key based](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html) authentication to connect to S3.

## Functionality

Carbon allows users to upload [text](https://docs.carbon.ai/learn/files/text), [image](https://docs.carbon.ai/learn/files/image), [video](https://docs.carbon.ai/learn/files/video). and [audio](https://docs.carbon.ai/learn/files/audio) file formats directly from Spaces Object Storage.


## Synchronization

#### Step 1: Generate IAM User and Access Key

Create an IAM user in AWS with the following permissions:

- **List all buckets:** Grant permissions to list all S3 buckets.
- **Read access to specific buckets and objects:** Allow read access to the buckets and objects intended for synchronization in Carbon. Ensure that new buckets added in the future grant access to this IAM user for object retrieval.

#### Step 2: Provide Credentials to Carbon

**Via API**: `POST` the generated credentials to the `/integrations/s3` endpoint in this format:

```json
{
    "access_key": "<<your-access-key>>",
    "access_key_secret": "<<access-key-secret>>"
}
```
**Via Carbon Connect**: Optionally you can input the credentials directly via the [Carbon Connect](/carbon-connect) component.

#### Step 3: List Files and Buckets
Optionally load all available S3 buckets and objects by using _*POST*_ `/integrations/items/sync` and list them via _*POST*_ `/integrations/items/list`.

#### Step 4: Sync Files or Buckets
Use the `/integrations/s3/files` endpoint to sync specific file objects or buckets.

For syncing specific files (multiple files allowed):
```json
{
    "ids": [{"bucket": "bucket-name", "id": "object-key"}],
    "tags": "...",
    "chunk_size": "...",
    "chunk_overlap": "...",
    "skip_embedding_generation": "..."
}
```

For syncing all files from buckets (multiple buckets allowed):
```json
{
    "ids": [{"bucket": "bucket-name"}],
    "tags": "...",
    "chunk_size": "...",
    "chunk_overlap": "...",
    "skip_embedding_generation": "..."
}
```

You can also use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific S3 files. To delete S3 files from Carbon, you can use the `delete_file` endpoint directly.

To sync S3 files on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the `/update_users` endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated S3 content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["S3"]
}
