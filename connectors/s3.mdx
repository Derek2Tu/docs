## Authorization Type

Carbon uses [Access Key based](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html) authentication to connect to S3.

## Functionality

Carbon allows users to upload `pdf`, `docx`, `pptx`, `txt`, `csv`, `rtf`, `tsv`, `xlsx` and `md` files directly from S3.

## Synchronization

Syncs are triggered when end-users select files to upload via the S3 file selector UI. You can also use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific S3 files. To delete S3 files from Carbon, you can use the `deletefile` endpoint directly.

We do not run our 24-hour batch sync for S3 by default. If you'd like us to enable batch syncs to run in the background, you can request this via Slack.
