## Functionality

Carbon syncs all `Published` articles under a single Freshdesk workspace. Any Draft article wonâ€™t be synced. We currently support only having a single Freshdesk workspace connected per `customer_id`.

## Synchronization
Syncs are triggered when end-users connects their Freshdesk account. You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Freshdesk files.

In addition, we have a 24-hour batch sync running in the background. You can request us via Slack to run more frequent batch syncs.
