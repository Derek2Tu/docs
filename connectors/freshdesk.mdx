## Functionality
The `/integrations/freshdesk` and `integrations/connect` endpoints sync articles by default. 

To customize the sync behavior, use the `file_sync_config` parameter:

```
"file_sync_config": {
  "auto_synced_source_types": ["TICKET"],
  "sync_attachments": true
}
```

- `auto_synced_source_types`: An array specifying the types of items to sync. Valid values are "ARTICLE" (default) and "TICKET". To sync both articles and tickets, include both values in the array.
- `sync_attachments`: A boolean indicating whether to sync attachments from ticket comments. Set to true to enable attachment syncing.

#### Additional Endpoints
The following endpoints can be used with Freshdesk to list and sync items:
- `integrations/items/sync`: Sync items from Freshdesk
- `integrations/items/list`: List items from Freshdesk
- `integrations/files/sync`: Sync files from Freshdesk
#### Articles
Carbon can sync `Published` articles from multiple Freshdesk workspaces. Note that `Draft` articles will not be synced.
#### Tickets
<Note>Freshdesk has a limit of 5,000 ticket syncs. To increase this limit, please contact our team directly.</Note>
Carbon can sync tickets and their associated file attachments. The following ticket information is available as tags for filtering:

```
{
  "ticket_type": "incident",
  "ticket_status": "open", 
  "ticket_assignee": "swapnil@carbon.ai",
  "ticket_priority": "normal",
  "ticket_requester": "customer@example.com"
}
````

Use these tags to filter and organize synced tickets based on their properties.

## Synchronization
Syncs are triggered when end-users connects their Freshdesk account. You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Freshdesk files.

To sync Freshdesk pages on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the `/update_users` endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated Freshdesk content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["FRESHDESK"]
}
