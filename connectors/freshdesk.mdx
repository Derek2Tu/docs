## Functionality

Carbon syncs all `Published` articles under a single Freshdesk workspace. Any Draft article wonâ€™t be synced.

## Synchronization
Syncs are triggered when end-users connects their Freshdesk account. You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Freshdesk files.

To sync Freshdesk pages on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the `/update_users` endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated Freshdesk content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["FRESHDESK"]
}
