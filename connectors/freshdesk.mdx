## Functionality

Carbon syncs all `Published` articles under a single Freshdesk workspace. Any Draft article won’t be synced. We currently support only having a single Freshdesk workspace connected per `customer_id`.

## Synchronization
Syncs are triggered when end-users connects their Freshdesk account. You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Freshdesk files.

We do not run our 24-hour batch sync for Salesforce by default. If you’d like us to enable batch syncs to run in the background, you can request this via Slack.
