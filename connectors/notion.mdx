## Authorization Type

Carbon uses **[OAuth 2.0](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization)** to connect to Notion workspaces.

## Authorization Flow

## Functionality

Carbon enables end-users to select top-level pages for synchronization and automatically syncs all sub-pages. For instance, a top-level Company page may contain sub-pages for **`Company Benefits`** and **`PTO Policy`**. Once the end-user selects the Company page in the Authorization flow, Carbon automatically includes the sub-pages **`Company Benefits`** or **`PTO Policy`** to be synced.

## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials

1. After you log into your Notion workspace, click [here](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) to navigate to the "My Integrations" page.

2. Click the "+ New Integration" button to create your OAuth app.

3. Enter the name for your app and upload an logo image. Click "Submit" afterwards.

7. Add https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/notion as the "Redirect URIs". You can also use a custom CNAME record pointing to https://api.carbon.ai but the domain path must still be `/integrations/notion`.

## Synchronization

Syncs are triggered when end-users add or remove pages via the Notion OAuth flow. You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Notion files.

In addition, we have a 24-hour batch sync running in the background. You can request us via Slack to run more frequent batch syncs. 

When a user adds a nested page or database record under a selected Notion page, we auto-sync those documents as well.
