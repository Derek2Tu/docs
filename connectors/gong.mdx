## Authorization Type

Carbon uses [OAuth 2.0](https://help.gong.io/docs/create-an-app-for-gong?highlight=oauth) to connect to Gong.

## Functionality

Carbon has the ability to synchronize Gong calls and retrieve the transcripts.

By default, the Gong connector will sync all of your workspaces and calls. However, you can customize this behavior:
- To turn off automatic syncing of all workspaces and calls, set the `sync_files_on_connection` parameter to `false` when configuring the connector.
- To manually sync specific workspaces or calls, use the global endpoints (`/integrations/items/list` and `/integrations/files/sync`).

To include speaker names and emails (when available), set the `include_speaker_labels` flag under `file_sync_config` to `true`.

## Authorization Flow

To set up the Gong connector:
- Enter your Gong account email in the `gong_account_email` field. This is required to generate the OAuth URL.
- Click on Generate OAuth URL to get the authorization URL.
- Click on the generated URL to authorize Carbon to access your Gong account.
- Once authorized, your Gong connector will be set up and ready to sync data.

## Configuration

6. Add the following URLs: https://api.carbon.ai/integrations/gong under "Redirect URI Needed for the OAuth Authorization Code Flow" and https://api.carbon.ai under "Domain". You can also use a custom CNAME record that points to https://api.carbon.ai, but the domain path must still be /integrations/gong.

7. Make sure to click "Save" to save your updates.

## Synchronization

You can also use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Gong calls. To delete Gong calls from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

To sync Gong files on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the /update_users endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

New calls are auto-synced from existing workspaces but any new workspaces created later will require syncing manually.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated Gong content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["GONG"]
} 
```
