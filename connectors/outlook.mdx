## Synchronization

After successfully connecting your Outlook account, you have the flexibility to choose which emails to sync using the filters and folder parameters via the `integrations/outlook/sync` endpoint.

#### Filters Parameter
The filters parameter is a JSON object with key-value pairs, supporting AND and OR operations. 

Below are the supported filter keys:

#### `category`
Custom categories created in Outlook.

#### `after`
Accepts a date in the format YYYY/mm/dd (e.g., 2023/12/31), enabling the retrieval of emails after a specified date.

#### `before`
Accepts a date in the format YYYY/mm/dd (e.g., 2023/12/31), enabling the retrieval of emails before a specified date.

#### `from`
Supports an email (`email@address.com`) as a string from which the email was sent.


Here are some examples:

```json
{
    "filters": {
        "key": "category",
        "value": "Test"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "filters": {
        "key": "after",
        "value": "2024/01/07"
    }
}
```
#### Folder Parameter
The folder parameter allows you to specify the folder from which to sync emails. By default, emails are retrieved from the inbox folder. To specify a custom folder, include it in the query:

```json
{
    "folder": "Folder Name",
    "filters": {
        "key": "category",
        "value": "Test"
    }
}
```

#### Combining Filters and Operations
You can use AND and OR operations for more complex queries. Here's an example:

```json
{
    "filters": {
        "AND": [
            {
                "key": "after",
                "value": "2024/01/07"
            },
            {
                "OR": [
                    {
                        "key": "category",
                        "value": "Personal"
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "category",
                        "value": "Test"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
````

You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Outlook emails. To delete specific emails from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

To sync Outlook emails on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the `/update_users` endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated Outlook content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["OUTLOOK"]
}
