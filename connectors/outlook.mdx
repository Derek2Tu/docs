## Synchronization

After successfully connecting your Outlook account, you have the flexibility to choose which emails to sync using the filters and folder parameters via the `integrations/outlook/sync` endpoint.

#### Filters Parameter
The filters parameter is a JSON object with key-value pairs, supporting AND and OR operations. 

Below are the supported filter keys:

#### `category`
Custom categories created in Outlook.

#### `after`
Accepts a date in the format YYYY/mm/dd (e.g., 2023/12/31), enabling the retrieval of emails after a specified date.

#### `before`
Accepts a date in the format YYYY/mm/dd (e.g., 2023/12/31), enabling the retrieval of emails before a specified date.

#### `from`
Supports an email (`email@address.com`) as a string from which the email was sent.

#### `has`
Supports the value `attachment` as a string to filter for all emails sent from an account.

Here are some examples:

```json
{
    "filters": {
        "key": "category",
        "value": "Test"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "filters": {
        "key": "after",
        "value": "2024/01/07"
    }
}
```
#### Folder Parameter
The folder parameter allows you to specify the folder from which to sync emails. By default, emails are retrieved from the inbox folder. To specify a custom folder, include it in the query:

```json
{
    "folder": "Folder Name",
    "filters": {
        "key": "category",
        "value": "Test"
    }
}
```

#### Combining Filters and Operations
You can use AND and OR operations for more complex queries. Here's an example:

```json
{
    "filters": {
        "AND": [
            {
                "key": "after",
                "value": "2024/01/07"
            },
            {
                "OR": [
                    {
                        "key": "category",
                        "value": "Personal"
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "category",
                        "value": "Test"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
````

You can use the `resync_file` API endpoint to programmatically resync specific Outlook emails. To delete specific emails from Carbon, you can use the `delete_files` endpoint directly.

To sync Outlook emails on a 24-hour schedule (_more frequent schedules available upon request_), you can use the `/update_users` endpoint. This endpoint allows organizations to customize syncing settings according to their requirements, with the option to enable syncing for all data sources using the string 'ALL'. It's important to note that each request supports up to 100 customer IDs.

Here's an example illustrating how to automatically enable syncing for updated Outlook content for specified users:

```
{
    "customer_ids": ["team@carbon.ai", "sam@openai.com"],
    "auto_sync_enabled_sources": ["OUTLOOK"]
} 
```



## Microsoft Admin Approval

To allow Carbon to access your Microsoft applications (OneDrive and SharePoints), users might need to request admin consent approval. 

Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Gone through Carbon's managed OAuth flow and submitted the admin consent request (see screenshot below):
![](https://imagedelivery.net/_sHUUMiZokZ59YDFOZEZTw/e93b438c-a787-4d28-b3e6-4c36f613e600/public)
- An administrator role or designated reviewer role to review admin consent requests

### Approve the Request

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a Cloud Application Administrator who is a designated reviewer.

2. Navigate to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**.

3. Under **Activity**, select **Admin consent requests**.

4. Select the **My Pending** tab to view and act on the pending requests.

5. From the list, select the Carbon application that is being requested.

6. Review the request details:
   - Select **Review permissions and consent** to see what permissions are being requested by Carbon.
   - Select the **App details** tab to view the application details.
   - Select the **Requested by** tab to see who is requesting access and why.

7. **Approve the request** to grant admin consent to allow Carbon to access your Microsoft application. All requestors will be notified that their request for access is granted. This allows all users in your tenant to access Carbon unless otherwise restricted with user assignment.

<Card title="Do You Have the Right Permissions?">

If you are unable to consent to the approval request under _*My Pending*_ because the admin consent flow has not been activated, then you will need _*Global Administrator*_ permissions.
Once you are a _*Global Administrator*_, you can set up the admin consent flow or consent directly via Carbon’s managed OAuth flow.
