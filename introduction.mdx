## What is Carbon?

Carbon provides a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the process of connecting external data sources to Large Language Models (LLMs). 

The Carbon search model is purpose-built for Large Language Models (LLMs) because of its fully neural architecture, enabling natural language querying across indexed documents from external data sources. In cases where vector (or neural) search isn't optimal, Carbon also supports keyword-based searches.

Carbon simplifies the process of **retrieval augmented generation** (RAG), allowing you to spend more time using your data, and less time trying to ingest it.

## How Carbon Works

Use **[Carbon Connect](https://api.carbon.ai/redoc#tag/Carbon-Connect)** to connect to your users' data sources and then our **Universal API** to retrieve the data to use with LLMs. Carbon has native integrations with 10+ data sources and supports more than 20+ file formats, encompassing text, audio, and visual data.

Depending on your use case and in-house infrastructure, you can retrieve user data from Carbon in several formats: 

- Parsed plaintext files
- Embeddings (and chunks) to store in your vector store
- Direct semantic and keyword search against Carbon's managed vector database

## Products

### üîó Connect

A client-side component for users to connect data sources such as Notion, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, websites, and file uploads. Available as a React component, JavaScript SDK, and soon as a magic link. 

Carbon handles OAuth flows for 10+ sources, transforms the source data, and automates data synchronization.

### üóÑÔ∏è Store

Choose between Carbon's managed vector database (hosted on Qdrant Cloud) or your storage solution. The database updates as users modify connected sources and manage chunks alongside embeddings.

### üîå Universal API

Access and manage data (documents, chunks, vectors, etc.) from any source using our flexible API suite. Our API powers everything ‚Äî our Carbon Connect UI makes calls to the backend.
