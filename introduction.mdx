## What is Carbon?

Carbon provides a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the process of connecting external data sources to Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Carbon simplifies the process of **retrieval augmented generation** (RAG), allowing you to spend more time using your data, and less time trying to ingest it.

## How Carbon Works

Use our REST API or SDKs to sync user data sources and retrieve the data to use with LLMs. Carbon has native integrations with 20+ data connectors and supports more than 20+ file formats, encompassing text, audio, and visual data.

Depending on your use case and in-house infrastructure, you can retrieve user data from Carbon in several formats: 

- Parsed plaintext files
- Embeddings (and chunks) to store in your vector store
- Direct semantic and keyword search on a managed or self-hosted vector database

## Products

### 🔗 Connect

Client-side UI for users to authenticate and upload content from data sources such as Notion, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, websites, and file uploads. Available as a React component, SDK libraries, and soon as a magic link. 

Carbon handles authentication (OAuth 1 & 2, API key-based, etc) for 20+ sources, processes the source data, and automates data synchronization.

### 🗄️ Store

Choose between Carbon's managed vector database (hosted on Qdrant Cloud) or your storage solution. The database updates as users modify connected sources and manage chunks alongside embeddings.

### 🔌 Universal API

Access and manage data (documents, chunks, vectors, etc.) from any source using our flexible API suite. Our API powers everything — our Carbon Connect UI makes calls to the backend.
