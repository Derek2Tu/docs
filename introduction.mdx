## What is Carbon?

Carbon offers a comprehensive framework specifically designed to streamline the process of connecting external data sources to Large Language Models (LLMs).

Carbon significantly simplifies the process of _*Retrieval Augmented Generation*_ (RAG), allowing you to devote more time to using your data and less time to ingesting it.

## How Carbon Works

Use our [REST API](/api-reference/get-started) or [SDKs](/resources/sdks) to sync user data sources and retrieve the data to use with LLMs. Carbon has native integrations with 20+ data connectors and supports more than 20+ file formats, encompassing text, audio, and visual data.

Depending on your use case and in-house infrastructure, you can retrieve user data from Carbon in several formats: 

- Original file (PDF, CSV, etc.)
- Parsed plain text
- Chunks and embeddings to store in your vector store
- Semantic, keyword and hybrid search on a managed or self-hosted vector database

## Products

### üîó Connect

[Carbon Connect](/carbon-connect) provides a seamless client-side UI for users to authenticate and upload content from various data sources, including Notion, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, websites, and file uploads. Once authenticated, Carbon processes the source data and automates data synchronization to keep your application up-to-date with the connected sources.

You can integrate the Connect module into your application using a React component, SDK libraries, or a magic link (coming soon).

### üóÑÔ∏è Store

Carbon offers flexible storage options. You can choose between Carbon's managed vector database, hosted on Qdrant Cloud, or use your own custom vector store.
Embeddings and chunks in the connected vector store automatically updates as users modify connected sources.

### üîå Universal API

Carbon's Universal API allows you to access and manage data from any source, including documents, chunks, vectors, and other metadata.
Our flexible API suite powers all functionality, including the Carbon Connect UI which makes calls to the backend.

For detailed information on available endpoints, request/response formats, and code samples, refer to our [API Reference](/api-reference/get-started).
