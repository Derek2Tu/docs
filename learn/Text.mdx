OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model is used to generate text embeddings.

Carbon supports the following text files:

- `pdf`
- `xlsx`
- `csv`
- `docx`
- `txt`
- `md`
- `rtf`
- `tsv`
- `pptx`
- `json` (Coming Soon)

### pdf

For PDFs, we support rich metadata such as document `author` and `title`. When chunking PDFs, we can return coordinates points so users can highlight specific blocks of text in the actual PDF document.

### csv

For `csv` files, each row resides on its own line, and each element within the row has the header of its corresponding column added to it as a prefix.
