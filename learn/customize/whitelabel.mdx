### What Is Included

- Display your custom branding and remove all Carbon branding from the Carbon Connect modal.
    
    Elements that can be customized:
    
    * Logo
    * Brand Name
    * Link to ToS and Privacy Policy

- Ability to use your API credentials for each integration (Google Drive, Dropbox, Notion, etc.). You can check our [Connectors](/connectors) tab in our developer's documentation for more details on this.
    
- Hosting the success page on your own subdomain (ie: `data.example.com`) versus on `api.carbon.ai`. Minimal set-up effort is required here â€” all you need is to add a CNAME record for your custom subdomain and point it to api.carbon.ai.
