title: White Label
description: "Carbon allows for complete white-labeling of our product."

### What Is Included

- Display your custom branding and remove all Carbon branding from the Carbon Connect modal.
    
    Elements that can be customized:
    
    * Logo
    * Brand Name
    * Link to ToS and Privacy Policy

- Ability to use your API credentials for each integration (Google Drive, Dropbox, Notion, etc.). You can check our [Connectors](/connectors) tab in our developer's documentation for more details on this.
    
- Hosting the success page on your own subdomain (ie: `data.example.com`) versus on `api.carbon.ai`. Minimal set-up effort is required here — all you need is to add a CNAME record for your custom subdomain and point it to entri.carbon.ai.

### Implementation

<Note> Carbon will encrypt client secrets in our database, but return them unencrypted in the API responses. </Note>

If white-labeling is enabled for your organization, you can directly manage your OAuth credentials for white-labeling via the following endpoints:
- `/white_label/create`: Add OAuth credentials to white label data sources.
- `/white_label/delete`: Delete credentials for white-labeled data sources.
- `/white_label/update`: Update credentials for a white-labeled data source.
- `/white_label/update`: List credentials for white-labeled data sources.

Below is a list of data sources that can be white-labeling:
- NOTION
- GOOGLE_DRIVE
- BOX
- ONEDRIVE
- SHAREPOINT
- INTERCOM
- SLACK
- ZENDESK
- OUTLOOK
- GMAIL
- SERVICENOW
- SALESFORCE
- ZOTERO
- CONFLUENCE
- DROPBOX
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE
- GONG

For all these data source types, `client_id` and `redirect_uri` are required credentials. `client_secret` is optional for those who want to create data source with access tokens obtained outside of Carbon. For data source specific credentials:
- Google Drive takes an `api_key` optionally for those who want to use Google’s file picker
- OneDrive and Sharepoint take a `file_picker_client_id` and `file_picker_redirect_uri` for those who want to use Microsoft’s file picker.
