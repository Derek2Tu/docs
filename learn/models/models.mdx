### Overview
Carbon supports multiple embeddings models for various use cases and modalities.

## Supported Models
<Info>Carbon can help you switch between different embedding models. [Contact Us](emailto:team@carbon.ai)</Info>

#### Image Embeddings
| Model | Developer  | Embedding Size | Carbon Slug
| -------- | ------------- | ------ | ------|
| Embeddings for Multimodal     | Google  | 1408 | `VERTEX_MULTIMODAL`

### Usage
<Warning>Currently do not designate `VERTEX_MULTIMODAL` as an `embedding_model`. This model is automatically employed by Carbon when processing an image file.</Warning>

To define the embedding model, utilize the `embedding_model` parameter in the POST body for the `/embeddings` and other API endpoints. By default, if no specific model is provided, the system will use `OPENAI`.

During a vector search, only files with embeddings generated using the specified model are taken into consideration.

For example, if files A and B have embeddings generated with the `OPENAI` model, and files C and D with `COHERE_MULTILINGUAL_V3`, the system will default to considering only files A and B when a query is executed without `embedding_model` set.

Alternatively, if `COHERE_MULTILINGUAL_V3` is explicitly set as the `embedding_model` in the `/embeddings` endpoint, the search will exclusively consider files C and D.

_*It's important that all files intended for a query have embeddings generated using the same model.*_
