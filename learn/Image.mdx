We’ve added support for Google’s [Imagen model](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/overview) on Vertex AI for generating embeddings for images. This unlocks the ability for users to search through uploaded images either based on the description of the image content or the text within an image (similar to OCR).

Carbon supports the following image files:

- `jpg`
- `png`
