Note: The `customer-id` is required currently but only as a placeholder, and it is on our `TODO` list to remove this requirement. Webhooks are fired for specific files and have no explicit relationship to a specific `customer-id`.

Carbon offers a set of webhooks for a variety of events, listed below. Currently, there is no way to choose
which events to receive webhooks for - it's on our roadmap to allow for more fine-grained filtering. The steps
in setting up webhooks for your service are:
1. Add a URL to which webhoooks should be sent. This can be done using the `/add_webhook` endpoint.
2. Save the `signing_key` in the response somewhere safe - this can't be retrieved again.

At this point, all events will be sent to the URL specified in step 1. An event - sent via an HTTP POST
request - contains two important elements, a `Carbon-Signature` header and a body with a single key-value pair.
You can validate the authenticity and integrity of the webhook by calculating its signature. To do this, you should:
1. Extract the timestamp and signature.
    1. Extract the timestamp and signature from the `Carbon-Signature` header. It will be of the form
`Carbon-Signature:t=1492774577,v1=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd`.
    2. For those using JavaScript and decoding the request json via `JSON.stringify`, we suggest using the `Carbon-Signature-Compact`
header instead. It will have the form `Carbon-Signature:t=1492774577,v2=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd`.
2. Create a string of the form `{timestamp}.{request_body}`, where `request_body` is the entire request body.
Note that all values in the webhook request body are coerced to strings - this is *intentional*.
    1. If using `Carbon-Signature`, you can use `request_body` as is, or you can decode it as json. When decoding, ensure that the 
resulting json is formatted *exactly* as it is in `request_body`. In other words, the json should look like:
```
{"x": 5, "y": 6}
```
    2. If using `Carbon-Signature-V2`, when decoding the request body, ensure that the resulting json is in compact form, where there 
are no spaces between key-value pairs or between keys and values. For example,
```
{"x":5,"y":6}
```
Given a request body, `x`, you can do this in Python via `json.dumps(x, separators=[",", ":"])` or in JavaScript via `JSON.stringify(x)`.
3. Compute an HMAC of the above string with the SHA256 hash function. Use `signing_key` obtained from the `/add_webhook` endpoint as the key.
4. Compare the computed signature with the signature in the header (the value that `v1` - or `v2` - is equal to). If they're identical,
you can be assured that the webhook is both genuine and hasn't been tampered with.

Once you receive and handle the webhook, you should respond to the POST request with a 200 status - otherwise the webhook
will be retried (up to three times).

An organization is allowed up to *3* webhook URLs. To delete an existing URL, you can use the `/delete_webhook` endpoint.
To view all existing webhooks, use the `/webhooks` endpoint.

All webhook payloads have the form
```
{
    "payload": str
}
```
The value of `payload` (which is a stringified json object) will always have the form
```
{
    "webhook_type": WebhookType,
    "obj": {
        "object_type": WebhookObjectType,
        "object_id": str,
        "additional_information": dict[str, str] | str
    },
    "timestamp": str
}
```
Note that `WebhookType` is one of the webhook events described above. `WebhookObjectType` is limited to `FILE` currently.
`additional_information` is always a dictionary of string-string key-value pairs, unless it's empty, in which case it is
the string value "null". Finally, `timestamp` is an int POSIX timestamp as a string. Note that to use `object_id` in
subsequent API requests, you'll likely need to convert it to an int. `object_id` corresponds to the `file_id` of the file.
