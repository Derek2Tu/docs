## File Processing

We currently support the following webhook events for file processing:
#### `FILES_CREATED`
Sent when a user queues up a file to be synced for the first time. The body of the webhook will contain a list of `file_ids` for files that were created in the same upload, and multiple events could fire for the same upload if a lot of files were queued.
#### `ALL_UPLOADED_FILES_QUEUED`
Sent when every single item in an upload has been queued for sync, including all children of folders in an upload. The body will contain the upload’s `request_id`.
#### `FILE_READY`
Sent after a file has been fully processed and added to Carbon.
#### `FILE_ERROR`
Sent if there was an error during the file processing stage. If an error occurred, the file is requeued for reprocessing
    up to three times.
#### `FILE_DELETED`
Sent if a file has been successfully deleted.
#### `RATE_LIMIT_ERROR`
Sent if the organization has reached the rate limit for file processing. In this case, the file is requeued for reprocessing
    up to three times.
#### `FILE_SYNC_LIMIT_REACHED`
Sent if a organization user attempts to upload files that would cause them to exceed the organization daily upload limit (2.5GB per day), max file limit, max file per upload limit.
#### `SPARSE_VECTOR_GENERATION`
Sent when the status of sparse vector generation for a document changes. The webhook payload includes an `embedded` field in the `additional_information` object called `sparse_vector_queue_status`. This field can have one of three possible values: `queued`, `aborted`, `failed`.
#### `FILES_SKIPPED`
Sent when file processing is skipped. The body of the webhook will contain a list of `file_ids` for files and a reason in `additional_information`.

## Data Source Connections

We currently support the following webhook events for managing user connections to data sources:

#### `ADD` 
This event is fired when a user authenticates their account for a specific data source for the first time.

#### `UPDATE` 
This event is fired when a user selects one or more files for a particular data source. This event is fired once per file selection confirmation, regardless of how many files are selected.

#### `CANCEL` 
This event is fired when a user cancels the authentication flow. It's important to note that this event cannot capture tab-close events, so directly closing a tab is not within our tracking capabilities.

#### `REVOKE`
This event is fired when a user’s access token is revoked via the `/revoke_access_token` endpoint or when Carbon receives a 401 Unauthorized from the data source using an expired or revoked access token.

## Organization

We currently support the following webhook events for organizations:

#### `FILE_STATISTICS_AGGREGATED`
This event is fired when the organization's request to refresh usage metrics is successfully processed.

#### `CHECKUP`
This event is fired every 10s to check if a `FLAGGED` webhook is healthy again, and re-activate the webhook if we receive a `200` response.
