## File Processing

We currently support the following webhook events for file processing:
#### `FILE_READY`
Sent after a file has been fully processed and added to Carbon.
#### `FILE_ERROR`
Sent if there was an error during the file processing stage. If an error occurred, the file is requeued for reprocessing
    up to three times.
#### `FILE_DELETED`
Sent if a file has been successfully deleted.
#### `RATE_LIMIT_ERROR`
Sent if the organization has reached the rate limit for file processing. In this case, the file is requeued for reprocessing
    up to three times.
#### `FILE_SYNC_LIMIT_REACHED`
Sent if the organization has breached the 2.5 GB daily limit for uploads (this limit can be increased upon request). We return in the payload the `customer-id` of the user that exceeded the limit.

## Data Source Connections

We currently support the following webhook events for managing user connections to data sources:

#### `ADD` 
This event is fired when a user authenticates their account for a specific data source for the first time.

#### `UPDATE` 
This event is fired when a user selects one or more files for a particular data source. This event is fired once per file selection confirmation, regardless of how many files are selected.

#### `CANCEL` 
This event is fired when a user cancels the authentication flow. It's important to note that this event cannot capture tab-close events, so directly closing a tab is not within our tracking capabilities.

#### `REVOKE`
This event is triggered when a user's data source connection is revoked via the `/revoke_access_token` endpoint.

### Example Payload
