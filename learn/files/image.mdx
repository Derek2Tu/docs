We use Googleâ€™s [Multimodal Embedding model](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/overview) on Vertex AI for image embeddings. This allows users to search through uploaded images either based on the description of the image content or the text within an image (similar to OCR).
