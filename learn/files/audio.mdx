We use DeepGram's [Nova](https://deepgram.com/learn/nova-speech-to-text-whisper-api) model to transcribe audio to text and then the text is embedded via the embedding model of your choice.

The audio file is stored as the raw file (`raw_file`) and the text transcript is stored as the parsed file (`parsed_text_file`).

Carbon supports the following audio file formats:

| File Formats |
| -------- | 
| `MP3`     | 
| `MP4`     | 
| `MP2`   | 
| `AAC`     | 
| `WAV`     | 
| `FLAC`     | 
| `PCM`   | 
| `M4A`     | 
| `OGG`     | 
| `OPUS`   |  
| `WEBM`   |
