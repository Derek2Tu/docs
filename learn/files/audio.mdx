<Info>The maximum file size is 20 MB, but it can be increased upon request. However, please note that 3rd party connectors may have their own file size limits, which you can check [here](/connectors).</Info>

We use AssemblyAI and DeepGram's next-gen speech-to-text to transcribe audio to text and then the text is embedded via the embedding model of your choice.

The audio file is stored as the raw file (`raw_file`) and the text transcript is stored as the parsed file (`parsed_text_file`).

Carbon supports the following audio file formats:

| File Formats |
| -------- | 
| `MP3`     | 
| `MP4`     | 
| `MP2`   | 
| `AAC`     | 
| `WAV`     | 
| `FLAC`     | 
| `PCM`   | 
| `M4A`     | 
| `OGG`     | 
| `OPUS`   |  
| `WEBM`   |
