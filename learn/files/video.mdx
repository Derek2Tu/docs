We use Googleâ€™s [Multimodal Embedding model](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/overview) on Vertex AI to generate video embeddings. This allows users to search through uploaded videos based on the similarity of a video snippet to the search query or the text within the video frames, similar to OCR.
