Carbon supports the following text files formats:

| File | More Details                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `PDF`     | Carbon supports rich metadata such as document `author` and `title`. When chunking PDFs, we can return coordinates points so users can highlight specific blocks of text in the actual PDF document. |
| `XLSX`     | Each row is split on its own line, and each element within the row has the header of its corresponding column added to it as a prefix. Images and charts aren't supported yet.                        |
| `CSV`   | Every row is situated on an individual line, and each element within the row is prefixed with the header of its respective column. |
| `DOCX`     | Text content is extracted and converted to plain text.                     |
