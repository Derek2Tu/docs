title: Migration
---

Here's a guide on how to migrate existing embeddings and chunks to another vector database using Carbon.

### 1. Upload Files (Optional)

<Note>If you don't have the original file, you can upload a dummy file (e.g. an empty string or short string in the `/upload_text` endpoint).</Note>

Upload the appropriate files for the embeddings and chunks through the `uploadfile` or `upload_text` endpoint. If you plan to upload existing embeddings for the files, set `skip_embedding_generation` to true.

### 2. Upload Embeddings and chunks

Use the `upload_chunks_and_embeddings` endpoint to upload the corresponding chunks and embeddings for the files from the previous step. You can upload multiple chunks and their respective embeddings at once, as well as assign a sequential chunk number to each chunk.

<Note>We recommend batching 5 requests with a delay of 5 seconds.</Note>

Specify the model used to generate the embeddings through the `embedding_generator` parameter. Ensure the model is one of Carbon's supported embedding models (Check models [here](learn/models/models)).

### Example

```json
{
  "embedding_generator": "OPENAI",
  "chunks_and_embeddings": [
    {
      "file_id": 22952,
      "chunks_and_embeddings": [
        {
          "chunk": "The sky is blue",
          "embedding": [],
          "chunk_number": 0
        },
        {
          "chunk": "And you are too",
          "embedding": [],
          "chunk_number": 1
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "file_id": 22951,
      "chunks_and_embeddings": [
        {
          "chunk": "The sky is blue",
          "embedding": [],
          "chunk_number": 0
        },
        {
          "chunk": "And you are too",
          "embedding": [],
          "chunk_number": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

After completing steps #1 and #2, your files, chunks, and embeddings will be ready for use on Carbon. You can use them with our managed vector database or one that we directly integrate with.
