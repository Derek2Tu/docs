title: Filtering
---

<Info>Filters can be applied to the `embeddings` and `user_files_v2` endpoints.</Info>

For pre-filtering documents, using `tags_v2` is preferred to using `tags` (which is now deprecated). If both `tags_v2`
and `tags` are specified, `tags` is ignored. `tags_v2` enables
building complex filters through the use of "AND", "OR", and negation logic. 

Take the below input as an example:
```json
{
    "OR": [
        {
            "key": "subject",
            "value": "holy-bible",
            "negate": false
        },
        {
            "key": "person-of-interest",
            "value": "jesus christ",
            "negate": false
        },
        {
            "key": "genre",
            "value": "religion",
            "negate": true
        }
        {
            "AND": [
                {
                    "key": "subject",
                    "value": "tao-te-ching",
                    "negate": false
                },
                {
                    "key": "author",
                    "value": "lao-tzu",
                    "negate": false
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
In this case, files will be filtered such that:
1. "subject" = "holy-bible" OR
2. "person-of-interest" = "jesus christ" OR
3. "genre" != "religion" OR
4. "subject" = "tao-te-ching" AND "author" = "lao-tzu"

Note that the top level of the query must be either an "OR" or "AND" array. Currently, nesting is limited to 3.
For tag blocks (those with "key", "value", and "negate" keys), the following typing rules apply:
1. "key" isn't optional and must be a `string`
2. "value" isn't optional and can be `any` or list[`any`]
3. "negate" is optional and must be `true` or `false`. If present and `true`, then the filter block is negated in
the resulting query. It is `false` by default.
