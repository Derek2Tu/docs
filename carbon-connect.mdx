### File Upload

Users have the ability to choose files for upload, granting access to the contents of said files through Carbon's APIs.

#### Third-Party File Selectors

Many connectors feature their own file selectors, all of which are accessible directly through Carbon.

For connectors that don't have their own file selectors, Carbon provides an in-house file selector.
